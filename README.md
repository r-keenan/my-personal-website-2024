# My Personal Website 2024

I created this site using SvelteKit. This was built to replace my Next.js website that was created in 2021. My previous website's repo can be found here: [My Personal Website 2021 repo](https://github.com/r-keenan/my-personal-website)

You can find more out about SvelteKit by going here: [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

If you are unfamiliar with SvelteKit, and/or are unfamiliar with NPM, please see the instructions below on how to install the dependencies and run the code on your local machine.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
